            <h2>Impressionism</h2>
            <p>Impressionism can be considered the first distinctly
             modern movement in painting. Developing in Paris in
             the 1860s, its influence spread throughout Europe
             and eventually the United States. The Impressionists
             aimed to capture the momentary, sensory effect of a
             scene. To achieve this effect, many Impressionist
             artists moved from the studio to the streets and countryside,
                painting en plein air.</p>

                Edgar Degas sought to capture fleeting moments 
                in the flow of modern life, yet he showed
                little interest in painting plein-air landscapes,
                favoring scenes in theaters and caf√©s illuminated
                by artificial light, which he used to clarify 
                the contours of his figures, adhering to his 
                academic training.

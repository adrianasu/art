            <p>
                Claude Monet was the leader of
                the French Impressionist movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interested in painting in the
                open air and capturing natural light, Monet
                would later bring the technique to one of
                its most famous pinnacles with his series
                paintings, in which his observations of the
                same subject, viewed at various times of
                the day, were captured in numerous sequences.

                        <p>The artist intended the work to convey
                            the feeling of a casual family outing
                            rather than a formal portrait, and used
                            pose and placement to suggest that his 
                            wife and son interrupted their stroll while
                            he captured their likenesses. </p>

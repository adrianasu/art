                Claude Monet was the leader of 
                the French Impressionist movement. 
                Interested in painting in the 
                open air and capturing natural light, Monet
                would later bring the technique to one of 
                its most famous pinnacles with his series 
                paintings, in which his observations of the
                same subject, viewed at various times of 
                the day, were captured in numerous sequences.
